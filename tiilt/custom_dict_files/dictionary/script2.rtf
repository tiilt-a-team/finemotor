\f0\fs24 \cf2 in this blender video I'll be demonstrating how to make an animation of texts being balanced on top of a stream of water for this video i'll be using blender version 2.7 8a let's start by creating a new project so from the file menu select new and then click on reload startup file to make it easier to see the scale and location of the objects that we'll be adding switch from perspective to orthographic view by pressing five on the number pad when we rented the final animation it will be in perspective view now delete the cube by right-clicking on it to make sure that it's selected and then press X we're going to start by making a copper elbow fitting will do this by modifying a torus so press shift a and add a mesh torus over here on the left we can see some options for the torus change the major radius to 0.5 and the minor radius 20.3 by the way make sure that you set these options right after adding the torus that's because once you start modifying the torus these options can no longer be set now rotate it on the x-axis by pressing R then X than 90 then enter then scale it down in size by pressing s then point six then enter next we'll edit the shape of the tourists so press tab for edit mode then press 1 on the number pad for front view and zoom in verify that vertex select is selected then switch to wireframe mode so that vertices on the front and back can be selected at the same time now press a once or twice until nothing is selected then press be4 border select and select all of the vertices above the center then press X to delete and select vertices now press be4 border select and select all of the vertices on the right side of the center then press X to delete and select vertices now switch back to solid view this is what it should look like next hold down the Alt key and right-click the top edge to select all the vertices around the top then press e to extrude and then right-click to extrude without moving the vertices then scale up in size by pressing s than 1.1 then enter now it's screwed on the z axis by pressing e then Z then point2 then enter then press e to extrude and then right-click to extrude without moving the vertices then scale down in size by pressing s 10.9 then enter then extrude on the z axis by pressing e NZ then- point2 then enter next hold down the Alt key and right-click the right edge to select all the vertices around the edge then press e to extrude and then right-click to extrude without moving the vertices then scale up in size by pressing s than 1.1 then enter then extrude on the x-axis by pressing e then x 10.2 then enter now press e to extrude and then right-click to extrude without moving the vertices then scale down in size by pressing s 10.9 then enter now we'll smooth this out by adding a subdivision surface modifier so click the object modifiers button and add a subdivision surface modifier set the view and render values 22 you'll notice that the edges are rounded so we're going to add some more geometry to sharpen them up will do this by adding loop cuts so press control our position the mouse over this edge and then left click then slide it near this bottom edge and then left click again now will repeat this for somebody wedges so press control our position and mouse over this edge and then left click then slide it near this top edge and then left click again now press control our position and mouse over this inside edge and then left click then slide it near the top and left click again now will add two more loop cut so press control our position the mouse over this edge and then left click then slide it near this left edge and then left click again then press ctrl our position and mouse over this edge and then left click then slide it near the front edge and then left click again now we'll make a straight copper pipe with solder on the end so hold down the Alt key and right-click the inside edge to select all the vertices around the edge then duplicated and move it on the x-axis by pressing shift D then X then drag to the right and left click now it's screwed on the x-axis by pressing e then X 10.05 then enter then extrude again on the x-axis by pressing e then X then three then enter this pipe is going to have solder at the end so that we can see the solder while we're modeling the pipe let's add a material so press tab to switch to object mode then click the material button and then click new then come up here and change this from blender render to cycle surrender then click the use nodes button we want this material to look like a copper pipe so shut the surface type too glossy then set the Restless 2.15 now set the color to a hex value of e 796 6b main this material copper now switch to material view so that we can see the copper material will be making additional changes to this material later but this is good for now next we'll smooth it out a little so with the tools tab selected click the smooth button now let's finish modeling the pipe so press tab for edit mode the thought around the end of the pipe is going to use a different material so let's set that up so click the face select button so that we can select only faces then hold down the Alt key and right-click on the middle of an edge between two faces at the end then click this plus button to add a new material and then click the new button named the material solder then set the surface type too glossy she now set the roughness 2.05 will leave the color set to white for now now click the assign button so that this material will be used for the selected faces you'll notice that the new color extends past the selected faces will fix this later by adding more geometry to the pipe this edge forms the right side of the solder and we're going to move some of the vertices so that the edge will not be straight so click the vertex select button so that we can select vertices then right click one of the vertices to select it then while holding down the shift key right click on another vertex to add it to the selection then rotate the view to the back and shift right click a couple more vertices to add them to the selection now move the selected vertices on the x-axis by pressing G then X 10.05 then enter now will add more geometry to the pipes to prevent the solder color from extending too far to press ctrl R to add a loop cut position the mouse over the centre of the pipe and left click then drag it near this edge and left click again next we'll add some depth to the solder so press ctrl R for Lou cut position the mouse over one of the edges between to solder faces and left-click and drag all the way to the right and left click again then scale it up in size by pressing f10 1.02 then enter now will add another loop cut so press control our position and mouse at the same place that we did last time and left click then drag it near the right edge and left click again now the solder have some depth at the edge you can see it better if I press tab for object mode and switch the solid view i'll press tab again switch back to edit mode next will vary the thickness of the solder at the end so press ctrl R to add a loop cut position the mouse at the same place that we did last time and left click then drag it near the left edge and left click again now we're going to select the vertices at the end of the pipe so hold down the Alt key and right-click in the center of one of the edges at the end then from the Select menu select checker d select this will do select half of the vertices then scale up in size by pressing F than 1.1 then enter next we'll move the pipe into position since we currently have vertices on the pipe selected we can select all of the connected vertices by pressing ctrl L next drag the pipe on the x-axis by pressing G then X then position it next to the elbow fitting we're finished put the pipe modeling so press pad for object mode this is what it should look like this is a good time to save what i have so far from the file menu off select save as i'm going to name it float dots blend since we're going to be adding a fluid we need to define the area where the fluid will be located will do this by adding a cube so press shift a and a mesh cube then scale it up in size by pressing s than 1.5 then enter now switch to wireframe view so that we can see through the box then press 1 on the number pad for front view next drag the cube until the bottom of the cube is about three small grid divisions below the bottom of the pipe then Center the cube over the top opening in the pipe now press three on the number pad for right side view and verify that the cube is centered over the pipe then press 1 on the number pad to return to front view next we'll set up the cube to be the water domain so click the physics button you may need to resize this panel to bring the physics button interview then click the fluid button and for the type select domain domain is used to set the limits of the fluid it will also become the fluid itself next we're going to add a sphere that will be used to define the source of the water so press shift a and add a UV sphere then scale it down in size by pressing f10 point 15 then enter then move it by pressing G and then drag it until it's centered in the top opening of the pipe then drag it straight down to about here now press three on the number pad for right side view and then verify that the sphere is centered with the pipe then press 1 on the number pad to return to front view to use this fear is a water source click the fluid button and set the type to inflow then set the inflow velocity value for the z-direction 22.5 this will cost the water to flow straight up now let's add the text so press shift a and select text then rotated on the x-axis by pressing R then X than 90 then enter next we'll change the text so press tab for edit mode then press backspace to delete and enter your own text then press tab to return to object mode now we'll add some thickness to it so click the object data button and set the extrude value 2.1 to round out the edges set the bevel depth value 2.02 then set the resolution 23 to smooth out the beveled edges we're going to make the text and obstacle to the water in our fluid simulation so we need to convert it to a mess first to do that press alt see and select mesh from curve meta surf text now we'll make the text of fluid obstacle so click the physics button then click the fluid button and set the type to obstacle this will cause the fluid to interact with the text next we're going to move the origin point of the text so that it will rotate around its center so press tab for edit mode then press 1 on the number pad for front view then press a once or twice until the whole word is selected this is the origin point of the text drag the text to decide until the origin point is at the center of the text the origin point should also be at the bottom of the text now press tab to return to object mode next will position the text so press G to move it and position the origin point of the text on top of the pipe opening at the center then press three on the number pad for right side view and verify that the text is centered over the pipe then press 1 on the number pad to return to front view now move the text up on the z axis by pressing G then Z then point eight then enter it's ok if the text extends outside the domain box next we're going to add some noise to the location and rotation of the text so that it will look like it's bouncing around on top of the water so switch to the animation screen layout in the 3d View window switch to wireframe view and zoom in we don't need this panel on the right so i'll drag this edge over to make more room for the 3d View window this is the graph editor i'm going to expand its size we're going to use the graph editor to add noise to the location and rotation of the text so we need to add a keyframe to do that move the mouse cursor into the 3d View window and press the i key then select location rotation now put the triangle next to location rotation to see the individual channels next if the grass editors properties panel is not open then click the View menu and select properties now click the modifiers tab if you're using an older version of blender then there won't be a separate tab for the modifiers but you should still have a modifier section now let's add a noise modifier to the Z location so left click it to select it then click Add modifier and select noise then verify that the blend type is set to replace you can see the noise here to see what this does watch the text while i scrub the timeline you'll see the text bounce up and down on the z-axis how fast it balances can be controlled with the scale value i'm going to change it to a value of 10 to slow it down the distance that it bounces can be controlled with the strength value i'm going to use a value of point five this is what it looks like when i scrub the timeline we're going to add the noise modifier to the other location directions and to the rotation channels this can be done a little quicker if we copy these settings so click the copy button now click the white location channel and then click this button to add the copy to the channel i'm going to reduce the strength for this direction 2.1 also to prevent the movement from being in sync with the other directions set the offset value 25 will be using a different offset value for each of the channels that way none of the channels will be in sync with any of the other channels now click the X location channel and then click this button to add the copy to the channel then reduce the strength 2.1 then set the offset value to 10 now click the X rotation channel and then click this button to add the copy i'm going to keep the strength value set 2.54 the rotation channels set the offset value to 15 now click the Y rotation channel and then click this button to add the copy set the offset value to 20 now click the Z rotation channel and then click this button to add the copy set the offset value 225 I'll scrub the timeline to show you what this looks like switch back to the default screen layout now we're going to get ready to bake the fluid when we bake it r cubed that we set to be the domain will turn into our fluid so right click the cube to selected this is where you set the resolution for the fluid simulation increasing this value produces better fluid detail but it also increases the big-time higher values also require more memory the required memory is shown here make sure that the required memory is not beyond the capabilities of your computer the current required memory is 27 meg I'm going to use a resolution of 75 this increases the required memory to a little over 41 Meg our animation is going to end frame 200 set the end value 200 200 frames will result in an animation that is about eight seconds long this is the fluid simulation start and end values set the end time THU to this will result in a two second fluid simulation you should be aware that the length of the fluid simulation and the length of the animation are two different things the length of the animation is set with the started in the frame values and it's currently set to about eight seconds by setting the fluid simulation 22 seconds we're setting up blender to stretch a two second fluid simulation into an eight-second animation the result is that the fluid will play in slow motion at about one-quarter speed this entry box holds the location of the baked data the default location is a sub-directory in the directory where you saved your project if you use the same directory for another fluid simulation project then the two projects can interfere with each other to help prevent problems it's a good idea to save your fluid simulation projects in separate directories we're ready to run the fluid simulation now by baking it but i'm going to save the project first in case something goes wrong during the baking process now click the back button you can see the progress of the baking up here and you can stop it by clicking the X this is going to take a few minutes we'll all pause the video until it's done baking is done now it took my computer about three minutes under viewport display i'm going to select final so that i can get a more accurate view of how the fluid looks also switch to solid view to smooth out the fluid click the smooth button to see what this looks like so far off select frame number one and then click the play button up click the pause button now I don't want to use the first part of the animation where the fluid is just beginning to flow so i'm going to change the start frame 250 which will cut off the first part and make our animation about six seconds long this is what it looks like now when i play it now let's make a pan for the water to fall into so press shift a and a damn s cube then scale it up and size by pressing s than 1.5 then enter then scale it down in size on the z axis by pressing F then Z 10.09 then enter now press tab for edit mode and click the face select button so that we can select only faces then right-click the top face to select it then press X to delete and select faces now let's make a rim around the outside of the pan so click the add select button then hold down the Alt key and right click one of the top edges this will select all four of the top edges around the pan then press e to extrude and then right-click to extrude without moving the edges then scale up in size by pressing f10 1.05 then answer then extrude on the z axis by pressing e then Z then minus point zero seven then enter now press e to extrude and then right-click to extrude without moving the edges then scaled down in size by pressing s then point nine seven then enter next we'll bevel the edges so press eight wife to select all then press ctrl be then point 01 then enter now press tab for object mode next we're going to round out the edges by adding a subdivision surface modifier so click the object modifiers button and add a subdivision surface modifier set the view and render values to three and then click the smooth button now we'll move it into position so press 1 on the number pad for front view then drag the pan down until the bottom of the pan is even with the bottom of the fluid then drag it to the side until it's centered with the fluid it doesn't need to be perfect because we'll be making adjustments to the position later now press three on the number pad to switch the right side view and verify that the tan is centered then press 1 on the number pad to switch back to front view next film into the right edge of the pan the pipes should be resting on top of the pan if it's not then right-click the pipe to select it and move it straight up or down you shouldn't need to move it very far if at all now let's make a floor for the pan to sit on so press shift a and a mesh plane then drag it to the bottom of the pan then scale it up in size by pressing s than 100 then enter next we'll set up the light source so zoom out until you can see it looking at it from the front view i'm going to leave it in its default position which is about six grid divisions above the center and about for grid divisions to the right of the center now press three on the number pad for right side view then right click the lamp to select it and drag it until it's about one grade division to the left of the center now click the object data button make sure that the plate lamp is selected and set the size to three then click the youth nodes button and set the strength to 5,000 we're also going to use the background to light the scene so click the world button then click the color button and set the color to the maximum white color next we'll set up the materials for the objects in our scene we'll start with the floor so right click it to select it then click the material button and click new name this material floor will keep the diffuse surface type now click the button next to the white color and select image texture this will allow us to select an image for the surface i'm going to use this image of a concrete floor you can find a link to it in the video description after downloading the image click the Open button navigate to the image and selected next we need to UV unwrap the floor so that the image can be seen on it so switch to the compositing screen layout then click the shader nodes button to unwrap the floor we need to be an edit mode to move the mouse cursor into the 3d View window on the bottom and press tab for edit mode then press a once or twice until the whole floor is selected I'm going to switch to rendered view so that we can see what the floor will look like when it's rendered now press you to unwrap and select unwrap the image should now be visible on the floor next we'll set the scale for the image so in the uv/image editor window click the drop-down menu next to the new button and select the image that we added then zoom out this shows our floor object overlaid on the image now while still in the uv/image editor window press a once or twice until the floor is selected then scale it by pressing F then 12 then enter met we're going to darken the image by adding a gamma node so in the node editor window press shift a and select color and then gamma drop it on the connection going into the diffuse shader set the gamma value 21.8 next we'll add some depth to the texture by connecting the image color output to the displacement input now let's make some changes to the pipe material to make it look aged and dirty so switch the solid view and press cab for object mode now right-click the pipe to select it then press tab for edit mode then click the material button you may need to expand the panel on the right to bring the material button interview we used to materials for the pipe will work on the copper material first so click it to select it i'll switch to render view so that we can see what this looks like now we're going to mix in a black color so in the node editor window press shift a and select shader and then mix shader drop it on the connection coming out of the glossy shader then move the glossy shader to the bottom mix shader input then press shift a and select shader and then diffuse connect it to the top shader input then set the color to black now we're going to use the image of the concrete floor that we added earlier to control how these two shaders are mixed so press shift a and select texture and then image texture then connect the color output to the factor input now click the drop-down menu next to the Open button and select the concrete floor image that we added earlier for this image to have an effect we need to you be unwrapped the pipe so switch to solid view so that we can see which vertices are selected and press a once or twice until all of the vertices and the piper selected i'll switch back to render do now now position of you so that you're looking down on the pipe from the front then to unwrap the pipe press you and select project from view of human so that you can see the effect that it had the pipe now have spots on it that make it look age two and dirty now let's make some changes to the solder material so click it to select it the image of the concrete that we added is a gray color so i'm going to use that to set the color of the solder this will make the solder look dirty so in the node editor window press shift a and select texture and then image texture connect the color output to the glossy shader color input now click the drop-down menu next to the Open button and select the concrete floor image that we added earlier zoom in so that you can see the solder better now let's set up the material for the pan so switch the solid view then press cab for object mode now right-click the pan to select it for the material will start with the copper material and then modify it so click the drop-down menu next to the new button and select the copper material then click this plus button to make a copy of the material to prevent our changes from affecting the original copper material name this new material pan now in the 3d View window press tab for edit mode will be using the concrete image again for the pan to make it look aged and dirty so we need to use the unwrapped the pan so press a once or twice until all of the vertices in the pan are selected then press seven on the number pad for top view to unwrap the pan press you and select project from view next change the glossy color to a hex value of FF FF FF then set the roughness value 2.1 a foot surrendered view so that we can see what this looks like now let's set up the material for the text so switch the solid view then press tab for object mode now right click the text to select it then click the new button keep that a few surface type and set the color to a hex value of 9c 0000 name this material text now I'll switch to render view so that we can see what this looks like now we'll use the node editor to mix in a glossy color so when the node editor press shift a and select shader and then mix shader drop it on the connection coming out of the diffuse shader then press shift day and select shader and then glossy connect it to the bottom mix shader input then set the roughness 2.05 now press shift day and select input and then layer wait connect the facing output to the factor in put this will control how the diffuse and glossy shaders are blended together the surface areas that are angled away from the camera will use more of the glossy shader than the surface areas that are angled toward the camera now set the blend values 2.1 which seems to work well for this text sometimes when you use a glossy material for text there will be areas on the surface where the reflections do not look correct for example the top of this be near the left edge does not look quite right to fix this you can add an edge split modifier to do that click the object modifiers button and add an edge split modifier these default values work well the only material that's left to set up is the water so right click it to select it then click the material button and then click new set the surface type 2 glass next let's set up the camera view so switch to the default screen layout then press 0 on the number pad for camera view this is the view looking through the camera zoom in a little now I'm going to lock the camera to the view to do that press into open the properties panel and put a checkmark next to lock camera to view then press in again to close the properties panel now i can zoom pan and rotate while looking through the camera now I'll set up the view that I'd like to use i'm making sure that the top edge of the floor is a little outside the top edge of the camera view now let's fine tune the size and position of the pan so that it lines up with the water better so right-click the pan to select it then switch the material view so that we can see a contrast in color between the pan and water then press seven on the number pad for top view and zoom in we're going to scale the pan on the x-axis until the inside edges 50 edges of the water better so set the frame number 2 200 this is why the pan will be at its fullest then scale on the x-axis by pressing s then x 10.9 five then enter then drag the pan to the side until it's centered under the water now press 0 on the number pad to return to camera view you'll notice that a little bit of the water is showing through on the corners of the pan so dragged up and forward until no more water can be seen on the outside of the pan now let's send a setting up the animation so click the render button and then open the sample in section I'm going to set the number of render samples 250 the largest value is the better the final animation will look but the longer it will take to render sometimes you can get unwanted bright speckles in the rendered image these are sometimes referred to as fireflies to help prevent this i'm going to set the clamp indirect value 21 now come up to the output section this is where you set the directory where your animation will be saved click on this button and select the directory next click here to set the file format there are multiple movie formats that you can choose from i'm going to use auxiliary hora now we're ready to render the animation but i'm going to save the project first it's a good idea to save the project before rendering in case something goes wrong during the rendering process to render the animation click on the animation button if you want to stop the rendering process before it's done you can press the Escape key or you can click the X next to the render progress bar now i'll pause the video until it's done the animation is done rendering now it took my computer about 15 minutes to render this is the final frame that was rendered if you want to return to the previous view you can click this button and select 3d view to view the animation go to the render menu and click on play rendered animation or you can press ctrl f11 the animation will play through to the end and then start back at the beginning again now if you open up Windows File Explorer or something equivalent you can navigate to your movie file now assuming that you have a video player that will play the movie format that you specified you can now play your video i've set up this player to repeat the video in a loop so that it will keep playing well that concludes this video thanks for watching and please subscribe and leave a comment\
